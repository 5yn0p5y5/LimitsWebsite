# about

Limits is a company that makes hardware. We bought a bunch of expensive robots and equipment to do manufacturing and assembly locally. Currently we operate out of a 200 sq ft tiny garage and it's getting packed. Also everything is currently done by one guy.

We believe being closer to the manufacturing helps us design better, more customer centric products. It enables ultra-fast minor revisions which enables the community to comment on our designs and help make them better for the next person.
